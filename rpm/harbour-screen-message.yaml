Description: |
  This app turns your phone into a signboard. You type some text, it displays it
  as large as possible, black on white (or white on black, if you prefer), across
  the whole screen.

  It is useful to send messages across a room, e.g. during an university lecture. Or
  for many other things, which I probably have not yet thought of.
